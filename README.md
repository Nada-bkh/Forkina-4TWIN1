## Development Approach 🛠️  
1. **Modular Design**: Build reusable components for scalability.  
2. **AI-First**: Prioritize ethical AI tools (team matching, plagiarism checks).  
3. **Cultural Integration**: Use Tunisian-inspired UI/UX elements.  
4. **Agile Workflow**: Develop in sprints with iterative testing.  

## Important notes

Please use the ES syntax rather than the CommonJS syntax in the controllers and in the exports

**Example of what we need to use**
- Controller : const register = async (req, res) => {}
- Exporting the modules: export default router;

**Example of what we shouldn't use**
- Controller: exports.createUser = async (req, res) => {}
- Exporting the modules: module.exports = router;
